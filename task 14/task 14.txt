Pagination:-
to limit the overflow of the incomming data and to make the page lag free we use pagination in this 
we just limit the number of incomming data and call a limited amount of data lets say 5 to 10 and adds pages links down in the 
current page so, if user wants to see more products then he clicked on next page and another 10 products array gets
called so,pagination uses to call the data in small chunks instead of calling a big thousands of data at one time.

offset:-
offset or skip is used to determine which data needs to be sended suppose user have retrieved 20 products data and 
now he is gonna click on third page so, to determine that onclicking page 3 products from 21-30 got retriewed from the 
backend.
to determine offset is used;

limit:-
limit is used to determine the number of data needs to be sent per page;
