        <h1>Online Education Student Sample</h1>
        <p>Written during a height of US involvement in Iraq, 
           this essay manages the intriguing challenge of how a member of the military can make an effective 
           case for on-line graduate study. 
           The obvious need here, especially for an Air Force pilot of seven years, 
           is to keep the focus on academic interests rather than, say, 
           battle successes and the number of missions flown. 
           An additional challenge is to use military experience and vocabulary in a way that is not obscure 
           nor off-putting to academic selection committee members. To address these challenges, 
           this writer intertwines his literacy in matters both military and academic, 
           keeping focus on applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), 
           his chosen field of graduate study.</p>
